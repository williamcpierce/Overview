### On First Launch
- The app package is *unsigned* at this stage of development. Follow instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac) for your macOS version to run the application.
  - If you aren't comfortable running unsigned apps, you can also clone this project and build it yourself in Xcode 16.
