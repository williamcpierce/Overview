# Overview Project Funding Policy

## Summary

This document outlines the financial policies and procedures for the Overview project, including the handling of donations and financial transparency.

## Donations

### Use of Funds

Overview is a free and open source project that accepts donations solely to cover project-related expenses. All donations received will be used exclusively for:

-   Apple Developer Program fees ($99/year)
-   Domain registration and website hosting fees
-   Development tools and services (e.g., AI service subscriptions)
-   Other direct project expenses

No profits will be distributed to any individuals, including the project maintainer or contributors. Any funds in excess of current expenses will be reinvested in the project's development and distribution.

### Donation Methods

Donations to the project may be made through:

-   [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/williamcpierce) (preferred method)
-   [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/overview_app)

All donation methods will be clearly documented in the repository README.

-   All donations received (amounts and dates)
-   All expenses paid
-   Current balance
-   Documentation of all disbursements

This ensures full transparency in the project's financial management and use of donated funds.

### Regular Reports

Quarterly summaries of income and expenses will be published in the ledger repository.

### Fund Management

The project maintainer (William Pierce) is responsible for managing funds and maintaining the ledger.

### Donor Privacy

-   Donor names will remain anonymous in the ledger unless explicit permission is given for recognition
